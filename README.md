<h3 align="center">Hello, I am a computer practitioner who loves code. I am full of curiosity about various new technologies and developments in computer science, and I like to follow the latest trends of the industry and continue to learn and explore. Programming for me is not just a skill, but an expression of creativity. I love thinking about how technology can be used to improve lives and solve real-world problems.</h3>
